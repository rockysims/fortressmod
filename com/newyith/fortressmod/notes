onPlaced, clog unless its the only unclogged generator
onActivated, if (!oldestGenerator) clog else generate walls
onDeactivated, degenerate the walls it generated
onBroken, if (oldestGenerator) clog the others

Maybe:
1) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 dark stone blocks around an emerald ore block
    darkstone dust is produced by fortress generators at a rate determined by the number of wall blocks generated
2) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 fortress generators around an emerald ore block?

Still Need:
Done? (double check):
    TODO: figure out why it takes so long to generate/degenerate when against a huge wall (smooth stone). figure out how to make it faster
        TODO: when generating rather than searching for connected generators use allCorePoints saved in ModWorldData (this avoids a range*2 search)
    TODO: fix issue where placing fg 64+1 blocks from another fg but connected to its wall will turn off wall
        maybe fix is: when searching for oldest, double search range
TODO: consider adding generator range to fortress manual
TODO: review expansion of generators section in fortress manual (write it better? or good enough)
remove debug recipes
TODO: consider adding glowstone to emergency key recipe (1 glowstone block in the middle?)
TODO: make generator emit light when burning (active)
TODO: consider issue of 2 fortresses semi close to each other and built up until eventually they connect and one fortress is controlled by other
    Maybe fix is: make generators play nice instead of clogging:
        make generators not degenerate connected wall unless its the only generator connected (128 search range)
            this fixes major issue of breaking into other fortresses
                and reintroduces issue of being able to build a fortress around someone else's fortress
        //when generating, generate all connected wall points (connected without traversing wall points belonging to other generators within 128 (or within 1 layer of wall belonging to other generators))
        when generating, find points to generate as follows:
            connectedFGs = all generators connected to this generator (128 search range)
            claimedPoints = merge of claimedPoints of all connectedFGs
            wallPoints = all connected wall points ignoring (and not traversing) claimedPoints (64 search range)
            generate wallPoints and set core.wallPoints = wallPoints
        TODO: set core.claimedPoints when generating wall or onPlaced
        TODO: replace clogging logic with whatever makes sense (usually generating anyway and letting it figure it out)
TODO: remove override that can prevent emergency key from working
TODO: make generator clog if generateWall called too many times (5?) within last 5 seconds or something
    this protects against rapid cycling of redstone power causing lag
TODO: keep track of claimedWallPoints and on getClaimedPoints() if not all claimedWallPoints are fortress wall then update claimed before returning
    this fixes issue where disconnected but still claimed wall couldn't be controlled by another generator
    this also increases lag but probably worth it
D? TODO: onPlaced, if generator is directly connected to another generator's claimedPoint, clog (and show message)
    message: "Generator is too close to another generator's fortress wall."
D   also make generator claim 3x3x3 around itself
    these 2 things (clogging when touching claimed and claiming 3x3x3) should ensure the generator always has visible effect when turned on next to generatable block types


Maybe:
TODO: consider making generators produce teleport home tokens from molten glowstone
    maybe??: 8 molten around 1 dust -> X teleport home tokens
    TODO: consider skipping this on the grounds that fortresses aren't supposed to be aware of who lives there
add generate/degenerate sounds
    https://www.freesound.org/people/PhreaKsAccount/sounds/46489/
    https://www.freesound.org/people/MiceHead/sounds/13294/
TODO: make redstone on == generator on (and not be paused if no potential redstone power adjacent) (if possible)


DONE: test what if while degenerating wall, long section is disconnected, then generate again. does the unconnected part stop half generated?
    yes but it still remembers it needs to degenerate the now disconnected part when next paused

Done:
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
add black and white pic of glowstone in fg fuel slot
manual book (crafted with 1 fortress generator)
add flames (like furnace has) to fortress generator when its active
animated generation/degeneration
add redstone power pauses generator feature
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs)
make fortress glass block
emergency key (quarts)


TODO: switch to using Deque instead of Stack

TODO: Later: add redstone controls (pause generation if powered) 
    or maybe redstone makes it regenerate walls (start generating new wall blocks like if you turned it off then on again)
