onPlaced, clog unless its the only unclogged generator
onActivated, if (!oldestGenerator) clog else generate walls
onDeactivated, degenerate the walls it generated
onBroken, if (oldestGenerator) clog the others

Maybe:
1) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 dark stone blocks around an emerald ore block
    darkstone dust is produced by fortress generators at a rate determined by the number of wall blocks generated
2) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 fortress generators around an emerald ore block?

Still Need:
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
    TODO: add 5 minute delay before teleport. cancelled by damage or moving more than 8 blocks from original location
    TODO: improve messages and cancel /stuck if player is damaged or gets too far from original location
    TODO: add check to make sure each player can only be /stuck once at a time
TODO: review expansion of generators section in fortress manual (write it better? or good enough)
TODO: consider making generators produce teleport home tokens from molten glowstone
TODO: maybe: give the role of obsidian in fortress doors to nether brick (or just plain nether rack?)

Maybe:
have fortress generator tell player how many other generator are in range (128) when its placed (so you can be sure yours is oldest)
add generate/degenerate sounds
    https://www.freesound.org/people/PhreaKsAccount/sounds/46489/
    https://www.freesound.org/people/MiceHead/sounds/13294/
add generating of user selected blocks (via placing block types to be generated in slots in fortress generator)
    add 16 custom wall (generates into bedrock) block slots with b&w pic of fortress bedrock
    add 16 custom wall (generates into glass) block slots with b&w pic of fortress glass
TODO: make redstone on == generator on (and not be paused if no potential redstone power adjacent) (if possible)


DONE: test what if while degenerating wall, long section is disconnected, then generate again. does the unconnected part stop half generated?
    yes but it still remembers it needs to degenerate the now disconnected part when next paused

Done:
add black and white pic of glowstone in fg fuel slot
manual book (crafted with 1 fortress generator)
add flames (like furnace has) to fortress generator when its active
animated generation/degeneration
add redstone power pauses generator feature
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs)
make fortress glass block
emergency key (quarts)


TODO: switch to using Deque instead of Stack

TODO: Later: add redstone controls (pause generation if powered) 
    or maybe redstone makes it regenerate walls (start generating new wall blocks like if you turned it off then on again)
