onPlaced, clog unless its the only unclogged generator
onActivated, if (!oldestGenerator) clog else generate walls
onDeactivated, degenerate the walls it generated
onBroken, if (oldestGenerator) clog the others

issues:
fixed: want to indicate immediately when a generator is placed such that it would clog if activated
fixed: could place generator near enemy wall, turn it on, connect it, turn it off: issue is wall updater would turn off enemy wall
fixed: what if a player is stuck in an enemy fortress?
fixed: could place generator near outside of fortress then connect it to wall to be new oldest if inside generator broken (moved)

Maybe:
1) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 dark stone blocks around an emerald ore block
    darkstone dust is produced by fortress generators at a rate determined by the number of wall blocks generated
2) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 fortress generators around an emerald ore block?

Still Need:
TODO: add flames (like furnace has) to fortress generator when its active
TODO: add mod config file (allow editing of how long glowstone burns for at least)
add generating of user selected blocks (via placing block types to be generated in slots in fortress generator)
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
add generate/degenerate sounds
get better textures from someone on forums

maybe: redstone power with signal strength of 1 applied to generator makes generator:
        degenerate only wall it didn't generate (provided its the oldest generator)
   on loses redstone power of 1 strength, do the same thing as losing redstone power in any other case
        generates wall (including enemy fortresses turned off with redstone power of 1 strength)

Done:
animated generation/degeneration
add redstone power pauses generator feature
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs)
make fortress glass block
emergency key (quarts)


TODO: switch to using Deque instead of Stack

TODO: Later: add redstone controls (pause generation if powered) 
    or maybe redstone makes it regenerate walls (start generating new wall blocks like if you turned it off then on again)
