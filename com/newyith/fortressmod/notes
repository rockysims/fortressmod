onPlaced, clog unless its the only unclogged generator
onActivated, if (!oldestGenerator) clog else generate walls
onDeactivated, degenerate the walls it generated
onBroken, if (oldestGenerator) clog the others

issues:
fixed: want to indicate immediately when a generator is placed such that it would clog if activated
fixed: could place generator near enemy wall, turn it on, connect it, turn it off: issue is wall updater would turn off enemy wall
fixed: what if a player is stuck in an enemy fortress?
fixed: could place generator near outside of fortress then connect it to wall to be new oldest if inside generator broken (moved)

Still Need:
manual book
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs) <------ //TODO: WORK ON DOORS NEXT
emergency key (quarts) <----------- DOING //TODO: make emergency key not work if generator is touching quartz block
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
make fortress glass block
add generate/degenerate sounds

TODO: look into burn time (NBT? ICrafting?) is cast to short

TODO: Later: add redstone controls (pause generation if powered)

TODO: switch to using Deque instead of Stack

TODO: consider: each ungenerated block type has its own custom block? how to do better?
    answer: store the block type along with the points upon generation

//TODO: in TileEntityFortressGenerator add "GeneratorCore core = new GeneratorCore(this);"
//core.onPlaced()
//core.onBroken()
//core.generate()
//core.degenerate()
//core.isClogged()
//core.isGenerating()
