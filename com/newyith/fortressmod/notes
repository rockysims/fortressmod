onPlaced, clog unless its the only unclogged generator
onActivated, if (!oldestGenerator) clog else generate walls
onDeactivated, degenerate the walls it generated
onBroken, if (oldestGenerator) clog the others

issues:
fixed: want to indicate immediately when a generator is placed such that it would clog if activated
fixed: could place generator near enemy wall, turn it on, connect it, turn it off: issue is wall updater would turn off enemy wall
fixed: what if a player is stuck in an enemy fortress?
fixed: could place generator near outside of fortress then connect it to wall to be new oldest if inside generator broken (moved)

Maybe:
1) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 dark stone blocks around an emerald ore block
    darkstone dust is produced by fortress generators at a rate determined by the number of wall blocks generated
2) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 fortress generators around an emerald ore block?

Still Need:
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs) <------ //TODO: WORK ON DOORS NEXT
    TODO: make fortress door ignore redstone signals
    make it so if there is an obsidian block over a fortress door the fortress door cannot be opened
        if there is a sign adjacent (6 faces) to the obsidian block, the door opens when right clicked by someone with a name on the sign
    make generating a fortress change iron doors into fortress doors
        add iron door as a wall type that changes to fortress door and preserves meta data
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
add generate/degenerate sounds
get better textures from someone on forums
manual book

Done:
make fortress glass block
emergency key (quarts)


TODO: switch to using Deque instead of Stack

TODO: Later: add redstone controls (pause generation if powered) 
    or maybe redstone makes it regenerate walls (start generating new wall blocks like if you turned it off then on again)
