Changes cobblestone, glass, obsidian, and doors (wood/iron) to an unbreakable version while fueled by glowstone dust.

Fortress Generator 2

Place the generator against a structure built of cobblestone, glass, obsidian, and/or doors (wood/iron).

While fueled, the generator will make the structure unbreakable (GLOWSTONE_BURN_TIME_HOURS hourGLOWSTONE_BURN_TIME_HOURS_S per glowstone dust).

Fortress Doors

Doors open for white-listed players only (on right click).

Place an obsidian block directly above the door and on that obsidian place a sign with player name(s) to white-list.

The white-list sign(s) can also be on any obsidian block connected (by obsidian) to the obsidian block directly above the door.

Sign format: One name on each line or comma separated list.

Clogging

If more than one fortress generator tries to control the same fortress, the newer generator will clog.

Pick up generator (with pickaxe) to unclog.
