Deployment issues:
none so far!

Still Need:
change license to MIT (GPL says changing it is not allowed)
better fortress generator gui bar (more granularity. maybe just digital clock in a frame?)
add formula to config to allow fuel cost to scale based on number of blocks generated?




Done:
make stairs (cobblestone and nether brick) generatable
add mc.fortress.mod@gmail.com to minecraft forge display about fortressmod
made fortress manual recipe: book + obsidian
give role of obsidian in doors to nether brick
review expansion of generators section in fortress manual
add support for hopper to fortress generator
add glowstone to emergency key recipe (1 glowstone block in the middle)
remove override that can prevent emergency key from working (quartz block)
make generator emit light when burning (active) and a little light when paused
keep track of claimedWallPoints and on getClaimedPoints() if not all claimedWallPoints are fortress wall then update claimed before returning (and degenerate whatever is unclaimed)
onPlaced, if generator is directly connected to another generator's claimedPoint, clog (and show message)
make generator claim 3x3x3 around itself
made generator clog if generateWall() called too often

Maybe:
consider adding FortressStructure class to wrap up generating/degenerating wall (actual not attempt) and claimedPoints, claimedWallPoints?
spawn a new thread to degenerate quickly (without animation) but not instantly (spread it out over multiple ticks)
test what if while degenerating wall, long section is disconnected, then generate again. does the unconnected part stop half generated?
    yes but it still remembers it needs to degenerate the now disconnected part when next paused
    TODO: retest this now?
TODO: consider making generators produce teleport home tokens from molten glowstone
    maybe??: 8 molten around 1 dust -> X teleport home tokens
    TODO: consider skipping this on the grounds that fortresses aren't supposed to be aware of who lives there
add generate/degenerate placeholder sounds
    https://www.freesound.org/people/PhreaKsAccount/sounds/46489/
    https://www.freesound.org/people/MiceHead/sounds/13294/

Maybe:
1) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 dark stone blocks around an emerald ore block
    darkstone dust is produced by fortress generators at a rate determined by the number of wall blocks generated
2) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 fortress generators around an emerald ore block?

Done (overall):
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
add black and white pic of glowstone in fg fuel slot
manual book (crafted with 1 fortress generator)
add flames (like furnace has) to fortress generator when its active
animated generation/degeneration
add redstone power pauses generator feature
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs)
make fortress glass block
emergency key (quarts)






onPlaced, clog unless its the only unclogged generator
onActivated, if (!oldestGenerator) clog else generate walls
onDeactivated, degenerate the walls it generated
onBroken, if (oldestGenerator) clog the others

onFortressGeneratorPlaced
    placedGenerator.timePlaced = now
    fgs = all fortress generators connected to placedGenerator by wall (not including placedGenerator)
    if (fgs.length > 0)
        turn placedGenerator into clogged generator

onFortressGeneratorStartsBurning
    fgs = all fortress generators connected to startedFg by wall (not including startedFg)
    foundOlderGenerator = false
    for (fg in fgs)
        if (fg.timePlaced < startedFg.timePlaced)
            //found older generator
            foundOlderGenerator = true
            break

    if (foundOlderGenerator)
        change startedFg into clogged generator
    else
        startedFg.generatedBlocks = startedFg.generateWalls()

onFortressGeneratorStopsBurning
