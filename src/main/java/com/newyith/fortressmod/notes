Deployment issues:
none so far!

Still Need:
youtube video
    make world for video and decided what to cover
github (with readme.md or w/e)
    provide download for compiled mod (.jar)
write post for wip mods forum
    note: see http://www.minecraftexe.com/bigtrees-mod/ for how to install a forge mod instructions

Youtube video outline:
music?
intro (hello, my name, mod name)
summary of what mod does
"I'm going to show you": list stuff to be covered in remainder of video
    stuff added by mod (items/blocks)
        manual, generator, emergency key (and fortress wall blocks?)
    crafting recipes
    demonstrate how to use everything
        generate small cobblestone house with windows and a door
        
end video after at most 15 minutes (ideally closer to 5 or 10)




Done:
add mc.fortress.mod@gmail.com to minecraft forge display about fortressmod
made fortress manual recipe: book + obsidian
give role of obsidian in doors to nether brick
review expansion of generators section in fortress manual
add support for hopper to fortress generator
add glowstone to emergency key recipe (1 glowstone block in the middle)
remove override that can prevent emergency key from working (quartz block)
make generator emit light when burning (active) and a little light when paused
keep track of claimedWallPoints and on getClaimedPoints() if not all claimedWallPoints are fortress wall then update claimed before returning (and degenerate whatever is unclaimed)
onPlaced, if generator is directly connected to another generator's claimedPoint, clog (and show message)
make generator claim 3x3x3 around itself
made generator clog if generateWall() called too often

Maybe:
consider adding FortressStructure class to wrap up generating/degenerating wall (actual not attempt) and claimedPoints, claimedWallPoints?
spawn a new thread to degenerate quickly (without animation) but not instantly (spread it out over multiple ticks)
test what if while degenerating wall, long section is disconnected, then generate again. does the unconnected part stop half generated?
    yes but it still remembers it needs to degenerate the now disconnected part when next paused
    TODO: retest this now?
TODO: consider making generators produce teleport home tokens from molten glowstone
    maybe??: 8 molten around 1 dust -> X teleport home tokens
    TODO: consider skipping this on the grounds that fortresses aren't supposed to be aware of who lives there
add generate/degenerate placeholder sounds
    https://www.freesound.org/people/PhreaKsAccount/sounds/46489/
    https://www.freesound.org/people/MiceHead/sounds/13294/

Maybe:
1) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 dark stone blocks around an emerald ore block
    darkstone dust is produced by fortress generators at a rate determined by the number of wall blocks generated
2) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 fortress generators around an emerald ore block?

Done (overall):
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
add black and white pic of glowstone in fg fuel slot
manual book (crafted with 1 fortress generator)
add flames (like furnace has) to fortress generator when its active
animated generation/degeneration
add redstone power pauses generator feature
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs)
make fortress glass block
emergency key (quarts)
