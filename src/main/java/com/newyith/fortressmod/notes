Deployment issues:
none so far!

Still Need:
ignore white list signs on outside of fortress
/stuck changes:
    make /stuck only work if your within range of a generator
    make it teleport you to right outside the wall?
make generator keep the chunk its in loaded (so fuel goes down when no one is around)?
    maybe only requires chunk to be loaded if its on? (so you can't just place generators with no fuel all over to keep world loaded causing lag)

maybe:
better fortress generator gui bar (more granularity. maybe just digital clock in a frame?)
instead of searching connected nether brick for white list signs, search connected signs for whitelist signs?
remove fortress nether brick block and stairs? (because you'll be able to protect arbitrary block types)
add formula to config to allow fuel cost to scale based on number of blocks generated?


Done:
change default /stuck delay to 30 seconds
reduce /stuck range so you can easily see where you came from
add 4 seconds to /stuck displayed count down
change license to MIT (GPL says changing it is not allowed)
----
make stairs (cobblestone and nether brick) generatable
add mc.fortress.mod@gmail.com to minecraft forge display about fortressmod
made fortress manual recipe: book + obsidian
give role of obsidian in doors to nether brick
review expansion of generators section in fortress manual
add support for hopper to fortress generator
add glowstone to emergency key recipe (1 glowstone block in the middle)
remove override that can prevent emergency key from working (quartz block)
make generator emit light when burning (active) and a little light when paused
keep track of claimedWallPoints and on getClaimedPoints() if not all claimedWallPoints are fortress wall then update claimed before returning (and degenerate whatever is unclaimed)
onPlaced, if generator is directly connected to another generator's claimedPoint, clog (and show message)
make generator claim 3x3x3 around itself
made generator clog if generateWall() called too often

Maybe:
consider adding FortressStructure class to wrap up generating/degenerating wall (actual not attempt) and claimedPoints, claimedWallPoints?
spawn a new thread to degenerate quickly (without animation) but not instantly (spread it out over multiple ticks)
test what if while degenerating wall, long section is disconnected, then generate again. does the unconnected part stop half generated?
    yes but it still remembers it needs to degenerate the now disconnected part when next paused
    TODO: retest this now?
TODO: consider making generators produce teleport home tokens from molten glowstone
    maybe??: 8 molten around 1 dust -> X teleport home tokens
    TODO: consider skipping this on the grounds that fortresses aren't supposed to be aware of who lives there
add generate/degenerate placeholder sounds
    https://www.freesound.org/people/PhreaKsAccount/sounds/46489/
    https://www.freesound.org/people/MiceHead/sounds/13294/

Maybe:
1) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 dark stone blocks around an emerald ore block
    darkstone dust is produced by fortress generators at a rate determined by the number of wall blocks generated
2) Fortress disruptors are crafted with 8 fortress generators around an emerald ore block?

Done (overall):
/stuck command to get you out of an enemy fortress (5 minutes then teleport to nearby)
add black and white pic of glowstone in fg fuel slot
manual book (crafted with 1 fortress generator)
add flames (like furnace has) to fortress generator when its active
animated generation/degeneration
add redstone power pauses generator feature
generation radius limit
fortress doors (with signs)
make fortress glass block
emergency key (quarts)






onPlaced, clog unless its the only unclogged generator
